# Umbraco Workflow Documentation

Umbraco Workflow allows the creation of multi-stage approval workflows when writing and publishing content. Umbraco Workflow extends Umbraco's out-of-the-box publishing model with multi-stage and configurable approval workflows. A workflow process comprises of multiple steps and multiple users assigned to the group responsible for providing approval at each step.

Umbraco Workflow Overview
{% endembed %}

Umbraco Workflow adds a [Content App](https://our.umbraco.com/Documentation/Extending/Content-Apps/) to all content nodes in the **Content** section where a workflow is enabled. For more information, see the [Workflow Content App](workflow-content-app.md) section.

A user can be a member of multiple groups in the same workflow. To initiate an approval workflow, a user updates the content, saves their changes, then selects **Request publish**.

The workflow Dashboard updates to reflect the state of each task, providing an overview of a user's submissions and tasks. Tasks can be approved, cancelled, or rejected from the **Dashboard** or from the content node **Workflow** tab. For more information, see the [Workflow Dashboards and Buttons](dashboards-and-buttons.md) section.
