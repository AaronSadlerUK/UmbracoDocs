## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers and users** who have at least a basic understanding of [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well as Umbraco backoffice principles.

As there is no code involved with using Vendr Deploy, the docs are purely a series of articles covering how installing and configuring Deploy.
