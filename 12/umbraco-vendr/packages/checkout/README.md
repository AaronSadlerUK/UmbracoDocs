## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers and users** who have at least a basic understanding of  [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well as Umbraco backoffice principles.

As there is no code involved with using Vendr checkout, the docs are purely a series of [Getting Started](getting-started/) steps to get Vendr Checkout installed and configured.
