## About Vendr Deploy

Vendr Deploy is a free and open source add-on package for Vendr, providing Umbraco Deploy / Cloud support, allowing the transfer of Vendr settings between environments.

In this section we will guide you through the key steps necessary to get you started with the Vendr Deploy package for Vendr.

It is assumed that before we begin that you already have an Umbraco Cloud v8+ website configured and pulled locally, or a regular Umbraco v8+ site configured with Umbraco Deploy, along with Vendr 1.3+ installed and a store set up. If you are not at this stage yet, please read the [core Vendr documentation](../../../../../core/) to learn how to get started with Vendr and return to this section once you have these requirements in place.
