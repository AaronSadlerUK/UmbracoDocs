## About Vendr Deploy

Vendr Deploy is a free and open source add-on package for Vendr, providing Umbraco Deploy / Cloud support, allowing the transfer of Vendr settings between environments.

## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers and users** who have at least a basic understanding of  [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well as Umbraco backoffice principles.

As there is no code involved with using Vendr Deploy, the docs are purely a series of [Getting Started](getting-started/) steps to get Vendr Deploy installed and configured.
