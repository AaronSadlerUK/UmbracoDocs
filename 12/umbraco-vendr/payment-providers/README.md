# What are Payment Providers?

Payment providers are essential for your Umbraco Vendr installation when you want to give users and customers to option to pay for your products.

While only the [Invoice](broken-reference) option comes with Umbraco Vendr out of the box, seven pre-built integrations for different providers are available for you to add to your site.

## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers and users** who have at least a basic understanding of  [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well as Umbraco backoffice principles.

As there is no code involved with using Vendr Deploy, the docs are purely a series of [Getting Started](getting-started/) steps to get Vendr Deploy installed and configured.
