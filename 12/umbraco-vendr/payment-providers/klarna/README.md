---

In this section we will guide you through the key steps necessary to get you started with the Klarna payment provider for Vendr.

It is assumed that before we begin that you already have an Umbraco v8+ website configured, with Vendr installed. If you are not at this stage yet, please read the [core Vendr documentation](../../../../../core/) to learn how to get started with Vendr and return to this section once you have these requirements in place.

<message-box type="warn" heading="Before you begin">

This Klarna payment provider is based on Klarna's hosted payment page API and requires you to sign an agreement to their Klarna Payments platform. If you are signed up to their Klarna Checkout platform, your credentials won't work for this provider.

Please make sure you are signed up with the correct agreement.

## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers** looking to implement the [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/) payment gateway into a Vendr eCommerce store. It is expected that you have at least a basic understanding of [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well the [Vendr core product](../../../../core/).

These docs are broken up into two keys sections, a [Getting Started](getting-started/) section for documentation on how to get up and running with the Klarna payment provider for Vendr, and a [How-to Guides](how-to-guides/) section for short guides on how to perform additional, non essential, Klarna related tasks.
