## About this Payment Provider

The Stripe payment provider provides functionality to capture payments via the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payment gateway. It is a fully featured payment provider allowing full control of the payment flow directly from the Vendr back-office.

## In this Section

It is assumed that before we begin that you already have an Umbraco v8+ website configured, with Vendr installed. If you are not at this stage yet, please read the [core Vendr documentation](../../../../../core/) to learn how to get started with Vendr and return to this section once you have these requirements in place.
