# Setting up the A/B test

Setting up an A/B test in uMS requires no code or need for any external tooling.

Starting A/B tests can be done in two ways:

- Via the Content App on the specific page you can start a Single Page test, Multiple Page test or a Document Type test.
- Via the Marketing section you can start Multiple Page tests and Document Type tests.

## Set up the test

Go to the node in the Umbraco content tree and open the A/B tests Content App.

Make sure that you have access to this Content App. [These permissions can be specified](/installing-umarketingsuite/settings-section/permissions/) per Document Types or User Group.

When you open the Content App you will have an overview of all the A/B tests that are running or finished. You also have the option to start a new test.

## Configure the A/B test

When you start a new test you will have to specify the following:

- The name of the test.
- Which testing project it should be part of.
- Write a description/hypothesis.

After that you have to specify the type of test and setup the specific test. It is also possible to preview your variant from here.

As a final step you need to specify which goal you want to measure, as it is all about optimizing for this goal. Set the audience that you want to include in the test.

## Launching the A/B test

Once you have set everything up the test is ready to go. You can preview the final variants and check if everything set up correct.

If that is the case you can start the test immediately, or schedule it for a later moment.
