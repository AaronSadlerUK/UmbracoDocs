# Types of A/B tests

Three different types of A/B tests are available in uMS:

- [Single page tests](/a-b-testing/types-of-a-b-tests/single-page-a-b-test/) to test a specific page within Umbraco.
- A way to test [Multiple pages](/a-b-testing/types-of-a-b-tests/multiple-pages/) at the same time.
- Test an entire [Document Type](/a-b-testing/types-of-a-b-tests/per-document-type/) and all of the pages using this type.
- [Split URL testing](./split-url-test.md). This gives you the option to select two or multiple pages and serve one of these urls per visitor. A good example implementation is when you want to test whether a single page checkout works better than a multistep checkout.

The A/B tests are set up within Umbraco and uses the context of Umbraco. You can reuse properties that are already created. uMS is also aware of the structure of your website and concepts like Document Types.

When setting up the A/B test, you can select the type of test that you want to setup.

A Single Page test can only be started in the A/B test [Content App](/the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/content-apps/) and not from the [uMS section](unpublished-item-51de601d-1366-488a-8ad8-0b7f52c02be5).
