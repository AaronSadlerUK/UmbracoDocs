# Bridging Library for Google Tag Manager

When using Google Tag Manager you can collect all events that you are already sending in uMS as well. This is setup in the same way as [classic Google Analytics](/analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/bridging-library-for-google-analytics/).

To include the file add the following code before the closing `body` tag in your HTML:

```html
<script src="~/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.ga-bridge.js"></script>
```
