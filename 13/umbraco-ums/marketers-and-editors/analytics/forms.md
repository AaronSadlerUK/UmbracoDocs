# Forms

In this article you can learn how data from Umbraco Forms is tracked with uMS.

## Installing the uMS Forms Addon

To track Umbraco Forms submissions, you need install [Umbraco Forms](https://umbraco.com/products/add-ons/forms/) with a valid license from Umbraco HQ. You also need to install the [uMS Forms Addon package from Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms).

## Summary

uMS measures interactions with Umbraco Forms on your website automatically if you include the [uMarketingSuite analytics JavaScript file](/analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/). No additional configuration is needed. The data is visualized in the backoffice in **Marketing > Analytics > Forms**.

The following is measured:

- The time a visitor started filling in the form.
- The time a visitor finished fillingnin the form (like when it was submitted).
- If the visitor has seen the form, like whether it was in their viewport.
- If the form was submitted successfully.
  - This is based on client-side validation only. If client-side validation passes it is seen as a successful submit.
- If the form raised any client-side errors, and how many.
- Focus/unfocus events of each field and whether the field was empty or contained data at that time.

## The report

In the Analytics section you will see a "Forms" tab where all data about your forms is gathered.

In this overview you can see:

- How many times a form has been shown.
- How many times a visitor started filling in the form.
- The number of times a form was submitted (filled in and hitting the "submit" button).
- How often a form was abandoned without submitting the form.
- How many errors were triggered in the form.

By clicking on the form you can drill down to this specific form and see more details for the specific form fields.

For each field you see:

- How many times did the field receive focus.
- How often was this field the last field before a visitor abandoned the form.
- How often an error was triggered on the specific field.

This data gives you insights on how to optimize your forms to create a better conversion rate.

Finally, you can drilldown to a specific field to see which type of error was triggered, be it a validation error or a mandatory error.

### Tracking a visitor Form submissions

It is possible to track a specific visitor to your website and see if they have made any form submissions. In order to do so, follow these steps:

1. Edit the Umbraco Form you wish to track visitors for and go to the **Design** view.
2. Add a new field to your form called '**Analytics - VisitorId**`.
3. Give the new form field a name such as **Visitor ID**.
4. Specify a URL in the settings of the field type called **Template**:

```console
https://**yoursite.com**/umbraco/#uMarketingSuite/profiles/profiles/insights?id=**[[visitor.id]]**`
```

The URL above is a deeplink to your website, including a visitor ID. By using a URL like this you can click directly through to view the visitor profile from Forms workflows. This includes emails, Slack messages as well as exported Excel data.

## Disable Umbraco Forms tracking

You can disable Umbraco Forms tracking on form level or on field level by adding the `umarketingsuite-no-tracking` attribute. The attribute needs to be added to either the form tag or to a field tag (like input, select, or textarea).
