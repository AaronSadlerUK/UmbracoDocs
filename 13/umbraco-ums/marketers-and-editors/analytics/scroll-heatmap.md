# Scroll Heatmap

The Scroll Heatmap shows you how your visitors consume your content.

The feature gives a visual representation of the average scroll-depth from your visitors on a specific page. This feature is only available within the Analytics Content App on a specific Umbraco page.

An advantage is that you do not need to integrate any 3rd-party tools. This will prevent additional load-times and possible issues with data ownership.

The heatmap is only collecting data if you have installed [the client-side script](/analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/) on your website.
