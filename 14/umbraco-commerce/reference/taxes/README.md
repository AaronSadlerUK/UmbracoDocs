# Taxes

Umbraco Commerce offers two different tax calculation method configurations for calculating an order's tax amounts.

### [Fixed Tax Rates](./fixed-tax-rates.md)

This option allows you to define a single fixed tax rate to apply for all products of the same type shipped to the same country. This option is useful for countries that have a fixed tax rate (the norm in EU countries).

### [Calculated Tax Rates](./calculated-tax-rates.md)

The calculated tax rate option allows you to dynamically calculate the tax obligations of an order by using third party calculation platforms. This is a more complex option that is useful for countries that have different tax rates for different types of products or for different regions within the country (the norm in the US).
