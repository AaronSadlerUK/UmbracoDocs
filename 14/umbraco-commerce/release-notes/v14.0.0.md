## New Backoffice UI

As with everything v14, this is a complete rebuild of the backoffice UI using web components. This ensures Umbraco Commerce is set for the future and creates a solid foundation to develop new features and functionality.

## Breaking Changes

With the new backoffice UI, there has inevitably been the need to change some functionalities, and as such breaking changes could not be avoided. These have tried to be minimized as much as possible, whilst also ensuring we embrace the new front-end architecture to its fullest.

The key breaking changes to expect are:

* **UI Config Files Removed**

Previously, in Umbraco Commerce, it was possible to configure the backoffice order list view, order editor, and analytics dashboards using JSON UI config files. These have now all been updated to use the new manifests pattern in Umbraco v14. For more details, see the [UI Extension Points](#ui-extension-points) section below.

In addition to this, the UI config files were also used in the backoffice to extract key order properties. For example, extracting the shipping address in order to calculate shipping rates. This functionality has now been split, and the  mapping functionality has been moved to a new server-based configuration API.

  ```
  builder.WithOrderPropertyConfigs()
    .Add("myStoreAlias", b => b
        .For(x => x.Customer.FirstName).MapFrom("firstName")
        .For(x => x.Customer.LastName).MapFrom("lastName")
        ...
    );
  ```

* **Web Notification Events Removed**

  The following notifications are no longer being fired.

  * `AnalyticsDashboardConfigParsingNotification`
  * `CartEditorConfigParsingNotification`
  * `OrderEditorConfigParsingNotification`
  * `StoreActionsRenderingNotification`
  * `ActivityLogEntriesRenderingNotification`

* **Web Controllers/Models Removed**

 With the new Management API, any controllers or models previously located in `Umbraco.Commerce.Cms.Web` have been removed. Please use the **Management API** instead.

  The only exception to this is the `PaymentController` which is used as a callback for payment gateways. This is currently kept at the same URL to prevent breakages for any existing transaction communications, however all new integrations should communicate with a new Payments API.

## UI Extension Points

With the new backoffice comes a new extensions system for the UI and we have tried to use this to the maximum. These means converting the old UI configs system to using the new manifests system.

With the new extension points it is possible to:

* Change the properties used by the order editor.
* Add properties to the order line properties editor.
* Add properties to the Notes, Additional Info and Customer Details modals.
* Add properties to the order collection view.
* Add analytics widgets (still in progress)
* Define custom views for properties to control value rendering.

Here is an example of how you would configure such properties

```javascript
export const manifests : Array<UcManifestOrderLineProperty> = [
    {
        type: 'ucOrderLineProperty',
        alias: 'Uc.OrderLineProperty.Color',
        name: 'Order Line Color',
        weight: 100,
        meta: {
            propertyAlias: 'color',
            editorUiAlias: 'Umb.PropertyEditorUi.EyeDropper',
            labelElementName: 'uc-mini-color-swatch'
        }
    },
    {
        type: 'ucOrderLineProperty',
        alias: 'Uc.OrderLineProperty.GiftMessage',
        name: 'Order Line Gift Message',
        weight: 100,
        meta: {
            propertyAlias: 'giftMessage',
            editorUiAlias: 'Umb.PropertyEditorUi.TextArea',
            summaryStyle: 'table'
        }
    }
];
```

With these extension points, the Umbraco Commerce order editor is now more flexible than it has ever been before.

{% hint style="info" %}
We are yet to launch an Umbraco Commerce NPM module so these points are not yet currently available to use externally but we wanted to give you a heads up of what is coming so you can prepare.
{% endhint %}

## Management API

As with the CMS, with the new UI comes a whole new API layer.

![Umbraco Commerce Management API](../media/v14/management-api.png)

With the Umbraco Commerce API we have aimed to keep it aligned with the Storefront API with support for filtering an expansion where possible.

A key thought whilst developing this API has been to ensure external developers might use this to build other UI's for Umbraco Commerce such as a dedicated mobile app and so we've tried to ensure there are no "special" endpoints just for the Umbraco CMS UI.

## Localization

One of the things that has been on the Umbraco Commerce TODO list for a while is to add backoffice localization support. Given the fresh start it was only logical that we take the time to ensure that everything we built fully supported localization so this will be included in this release.

With this update, we have also made some changes to things like payment and shipping providers, and other CSharp extension points where we define properties. These will no longer require hard coded labels / descriptions and instead will look these values up from the localization file.
