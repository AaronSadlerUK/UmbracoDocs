## UmbracoDeploy.config

You might notice a new file in your config folder called UmbracoDeploy.config. This files tells the deployment engine where to deploy to, it knows which environment you’re currently on (for example local or staging) and chooses the next environment in the list to deploy to.

**Note**: you’re free to update the “name” attribute to make it clearer in the interface where you’re deploying to. So if you want to name “Development” something like “The everything-goes area” then you can do that and it will be shown when deploying to that environment.
