# Upgrades

Umbraco Plumber will display a prompt on the Workflow section dashboard when a new version is available.

Displaying the prompt is determined by comparing the assembly version of the current installed version with the latest released version tagged in the GitHub repository.

If the remote version is newer than the installed package, the upgrade prompt displays the release notes and a link to the GitHub release. Updates should be installed via NuGet.
