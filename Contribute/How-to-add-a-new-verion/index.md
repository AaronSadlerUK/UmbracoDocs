# How to add a new version of an article

This tutorial will guide you throught the steps it takes to add a new version of an existing article in the Umbraco Documentation.

:::tip
The **current major version** on the Umbraco Documentation is currently set to Umbraco 8 (v8). This means that any content that isn't targetting a specific version will be recognized as v8 content.

If you want to help out with **updating our documentation against Umbraco 9** you can find more details about that process in the [Umbraco 9 Documentation](#umbraco-9-documentation) section at the bottom of this article.

## Prerequisites

To work with and contribute to the Umbraco Documentation there are a few tools and extensions we recommend that you use. Using these tools will ensure consistency throughout the documentation as well as help you create the best possible version of the article.

* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* Markdown linter - Extension for VS Code
* Vale - Extension for VS Code

We also highly recommend that you're familiar with Git and the Markdown syntax.

## Forking and/or cloning the documentation repository

The very first step to clone the documentation down to your local machine, so you can start working with it. This can be done by either forking the UmbracoDocs repository or by working in branches directly of the UmbracoDocs repository.

Do you prefer working in forks, we recommend that you follow our guide on [forking the UmbracoDocs repo](../Pull-Requests/#options-2-creating-a-pr-through-a-fork).

Do you prefer working in branches, follow the steps outlined below.

1. Clone the UmbracoDocs repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch using the prefix `v9/`.

## Tagging the article

## Updating the content
