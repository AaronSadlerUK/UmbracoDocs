# Extending the Umbraco Backoffice

The Umbraco backoffice itself can be customised and extended, this section is dedicated to getting started with these extension points.

Umbraco gives you the opportunity to create and customize packages, property editors content applications and even create your own dashboard. You can also extend on things like the search functionality, health checks, and various configurations.

In this section you will find some routes to how to do so and some tutorials to create your own personal packages and content applications. You need to have a _little bit_ of Angular knowledge here.
