# Creating websites with Umbraco 

To find out how Umbraco's backoffice can be customised for your specific needs, this section will detail the key concepts, templates and packages for you. 

There's also information on which frameworks, languages and flat platforms to use with Umbraco to create user friendly and responsive designs. 

We've even included a helpful tutorial which you can follow for creating a basic site to get you started. 

## How does Umbraco work?

Your website's content is based on a Document Type, published with a Template, each of these Document Types has properties made up of Data Types and each Data Type has an underlying Property Editor.
