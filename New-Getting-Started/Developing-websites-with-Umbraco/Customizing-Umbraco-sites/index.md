# Customizing Umbraco website

We will explain how to set up the environment and how to implement your custom templates with Umbraco’s backoffice. You will find all the tools that you’re going to need to install Umbraco and start developing immediately. 

There are also some tutorials on how to inject dependencies. Here you will also find some information about how the Umbraco pipeline works and how you can customize it for your own needs.
