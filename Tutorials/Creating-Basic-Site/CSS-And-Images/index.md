# CSS and Images

Our homepage is currently missing the CSS and image files. To include these files:

1. Navigate to the Umbraco Installation folder and the Custom Umbraco Template folder in File Explorer.
2. Copy the `css` and `images` folders from the Custom Umbraco template folder to the Umbraco installation directory.
3. Using Chrome/Firefox/Edge Developer Tools, start or refresh your `http://localhost:xxxx.` The network tab should not report any missing css or images files. If it does, check for typos and if the files are in the right places.
