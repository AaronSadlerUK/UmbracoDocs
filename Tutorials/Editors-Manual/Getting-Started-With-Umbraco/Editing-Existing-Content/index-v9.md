# Editing Existing Content

## Content Within the Tree View

When you are looking to edit content, locate the ***page*** you want to edit content in the section tree on the left-side of the screen.

To edit existing content, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Content** section.
2. Select the page in the section tree you wish to edit. The content of the page is loaded in the right-side editor.
3. Edit the contents of the page.
4. Click **Save** to ***save*** the edits without publishing it.
5. Click **Save and preview** to preview the changes.
6. Click **Save and publish** to publish the changes. For more information, see the [Save and publish](../Creating-Saving-and-Publishing-Content) article.

## View Page Layout

You can view Page layouts in three ways:

1. **Tree View**

    The tree view is present in the section tree on the left-side of the screen. For a growing website with multiple content pages, the tree view can become very large and unmanageable.

2. **List View**

    When a page enables listview, there will be no standard tree view for that page. When you click on the parent page, the child pages are displayed in the list view.

    To enable list view:
    1. Go to **Settings**.
    2. Navigate to the Document Type/page you wish to enable list view.
    3. Go to the **List View** tab.
    4. Toggle **Enable List view** and click **Save**.

    Additionally, you can sort the column **Name**, **Last edited**, and **Created by** in ascending or descending order to sort the list items.

3. **Tiles View**

    You can switch between list view and tiles view:
