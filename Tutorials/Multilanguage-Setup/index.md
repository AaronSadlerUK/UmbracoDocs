# Creating a Multilingual Site

In Umbraco 8 and above, you can use **language variants** to setup a multilingual site. **Language Variants** allows you to vary content by culture so you can allow a content node to exist in several languages. This tutorial explains how to make the site multilingual by making variations of our content.

## Adding a new language

To add a new language, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** section.
2. Go to **Languages** in the **Settings** tree. The **Languages** window opens in the editor.
3. Click **Add Language**. The **Add Language** window opens in the editor.
4. Select a **Language** from the dropdown list. In this tutorial, we will pick *Danish*.

5. In **Settings**, select the following options to set the new language as the:
    - Default language for your site, toggle **Default Language**.
    - Mandatory language for your site, toggle **Mandatory Language**.
6. Select a **Fallback Language** from the drop-down list.

7. Click **Save**.

Similarly, we can add more languages depending on the website requirements. For this tutorial, we'll use Danish (default language), English, and German as our variants.

1. Go to the **Settings** tab.
2. Select **Contact Us** from the **Document Types** folder.
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab and toggle **Allow vary by culture**

4. Click **Save**.

7. Click **Submit**.
8. For this tutorial, we will not make any changes to the **Address**. Click **Save**.

## Viewing the Language Variants in the Content section

When you return to your content node you will notice two things:

1. At the top of the content tree, there is a dropdown to view the content tree in the language of your choice.

   ![Variant Content Tree](images/Variant-content-tree.png)
2. To the right of the content name there is now a dropdown where you can select a language. You can also open a split view so you can see two languages at once.

## Adding Culture and Hostnames to the Root Node of the Website

To add culture and hostnames, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Content** tab.
2. Right-click on the **...** dots next to the **Contact Us** content node and select **Culture and Hostnames...**.
3. In the **Culture and Hostnames** tree, let's add a domain for each hostname, like it's done here:

    ![Culture and Hostnames](images/culture-and-hostnames.png)
4. Click **Save**.

## Adding Language Variants to the Content

To add language variants to the content, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Contact Us** node. You will find a language dropdown next to the title at the top:

    ![Language Variant dropdown](images/language-dropdown.png)
2. Click the dropdown and hover over the new language. You will see an **Open in Splitview** option will appear.

    ![Open Language in Splitview](images/open-in-splitview.png)
3. Click **Open in Splitview**. In this splitview, we can see the content node with each language side by side.

    You may notice that the **Address** and other fields are greyed out - this is because we haven't checked the **Allow vary by culture** checkbox.

    ![Splitview editing](images/splitview-editing.png)
4. Enter the **Name** for your content node and the **Page Title** in the new language.
5. Click **Save and Publish**. The **Ready to Publish** window opens providing the option to publish in one or more languages.

    ![Publishing Variant content](images/publishing-variant-content.png)
6. You can select either one or multiple languages and click **Publish**.

## Rendering Variant Content in Templates

To render the values of the Contact Us page, use the following in the template:

```csharp
@Model.Value("pageTitle")
```

The `.Value()` method has a number of optional parameters that support scenarios where we want to "fall-back" to some other content, when the property value does not exist on the current content item. To use the fallback type, add the `@using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Models.PublishedContent;` directive.

To display a value for a different language, if the language we are requesting does not have content populated:

```csharp
@Model.Value("pageTitle", "en-Us", fallback: Fallback.ToLanguage)
```

For more information, see the [Using fall-back methods](../../Fundamentals/Design/Rendering-Content/#using-fall-back-methods) article.

## Viewing the Language Variant on the Browser

To view the language variant on the browser, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Content** tab.
2. Select your new language from the language dropdown above your content tree.
3. Select the **Contact Us** node and go to the **Info** tab.
4. You will notice the links with the new language domain added to it. If it's not there, you might need to refresh the page.

     ![Viewing the Language Variant Link](images/viewing-langvariant-browser.png)
5. Click on the link to view the new language varied node in the browser.
6. Alternatively, you can add the domain name to your localhost in the browser. For example: <http://localhost:xxxx/da/>
