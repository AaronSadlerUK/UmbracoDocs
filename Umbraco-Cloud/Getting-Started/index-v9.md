## Umbraco Cloud Project

### Trial Project

The easiest way to get started with an Umbraco Cloud project is to take a 14-day free trial - [Try for Free](https://umbraco.com/?product_tour_id=103162). The project will automatically be created for you, and you are ready to get started within a few minutes.

Since we set up the entire project for you, we recommend that you get to know your project before you start building.

Once the project has been set up, you can choose to either start with a blank slate or go for a *Starter kit*, which will install a full template site for you.

To start working with and building your site, you can either work directly in the backoffice on the Cloud environment or you can [clone down the project to your local machine](../set-up/working-locally) - for Mac users, see [Working with UaaS-Cli](../Set-up/working-with-uaas-cli).

### Naming a Project

When you create a trial project for the first time, a unique project name will be generated for you. When you create a project from the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you will get to choose a name for the project.

You can at any time change the name of your project by using the [*Rename project*](../Set-up/project-settings/#renaming-and-deleting) option from the *Settings* menu.

An Umbraco Cloud project name is unique, which means if a project with the name you choose already exists, you will need to choose another name before you can create the project.

## Different ways to start an Umbraco Cloud project

You might not always want to start your Umbraco Cloud project with a clean slate. Perhaps you have an already existing site that you want to move on to the Cloud. For this purpose, we've created a [Migration guide](migrate-existing-site) that you can follow in order to successfully move your project to Umbraco Cloud.

If you are creating several similar projects, we have a feature called [Baselines](Baselines) that lets you create new projects based on existing Umbraco Cloud projects.
