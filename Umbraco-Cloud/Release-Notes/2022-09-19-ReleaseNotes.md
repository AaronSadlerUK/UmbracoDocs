You can easily select which region you would like to host your Umbraco Cloud project while creating a new Cloud project.

After saving your projects, you will be able to choose between a detailed view with relevant information for your projects such as environments, product versions, and bandwidth/media storage usage, or a more compact view with less information (you decide by using the “Settings” option).
