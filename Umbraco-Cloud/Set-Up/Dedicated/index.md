# Move your Umbraco Cloud project to dedicated resources

In this article, you can read about how you can ensure your Umbraco Cloud project to run on dedicated resources and what you need to be aware of before you do so.

## Before you move your project to dedicated resources

Before you decide to move your Umbraco Cloud project, you need to consider a few things:

- Currently, Umbraco Cloud offers dedicated resources for professional plans only. We expect to include dedicated resources for Starter and Standard plans in the self-service feature later in 2022.

- In case you want to move your Umbraco Cloud project with a Starter or Standard plan to a dedicated server in Umbraco Cloud, please reach out to our support that will assist you in doing this.

- Dedicated Resources are reserved on a per-month basis. Meaning that you will be charged for the resource from the start date to the end on that Month. If the resource is enabled in the beginning of the month, you will be charged for the whole month.

- Dedicated Resources are considered as an add-on that will be charged on top of the plan cost.

## How to upgrade your plan

The first step to move to a dedicated resource is to access your project in the project overview at [Umbraco.io](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/projects).

- In the project overview you can find all the projects that you have been invited to or have created.

- From here you need to find the project that you want to move to dedicated.

Under the project on the right side you have a dropdown menu called settings:

- Clicking on the tab will direct you to the _Dedicated resource_ page that guide you on how to upgrade to a dedicated plan.

- For a Umbraco Cloud project with a Shared Professional plan there are three dedidated plans for you to choose among.



- From here you can see the different plans, the price per month, and the limitations between each of the plans.
