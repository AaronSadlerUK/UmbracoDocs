## Where to contribute

Discover where you can make an impact and start contributing.

### Umbraco CMS

There are plenty of [up-for-grabs issues](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/issues?q=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Acommunity%2Fup-for-grabs+) to look at - a great starting point if youâ€™re not quite sure where to start.

We're also happy for you to work on translations or other problems you might know of that are not on the issue tracker yet.

Head on over to [the contributing guide for Umbraco-CMS](umbraco-cms/contributing.md) for the full details.

### Umbraco backoffice project

Codenamed "Bellissima", this is the replacement for the AngularJS backoffice.

Head on over to [the contributing guide for Umbraco.CMS.Backoffice](backoffice-project/contributing.md) for the full details.

### UI Library

The UI library contains all the UI elements for the backoffice. These are self-contained components that can be used in any project that needs a UI.

Head on over to [the contributing guide for Umbraco.UI](ui-library/contributing.md) for the full details.

### Documentation 

First off, there's a lot of documentation, and it's not always easy to keep it updated or know if we covered all the details you need to know to follow them. We would love your help to verify the documentation. That is, to follow the docs to the letter and see if youâ€™re successful or missing anything. 

Find detailed instructions on [how to contribute to the docs directly in the documentation site](documentation/getting-started/README.md). Here, we have outlined the steps involved with testing and checking the articles against our style guide. In the same article, you can also learn much more about the rules weâ€™re checking the docs against.

**Tip**: The best way to start helping with identifying where "rules are broken", we recommend that you install a tool called Vale on your local machine and use that along with an extension to Visual Studio code to run checks on a fork of the UmbracoDocs repository.

**Tip tip**: your PR will definitely get prioritized when it's changing less than about 5 files at a time, which makes it nice and easy to scan and merge the changes. So we recommend working in small chunks, also to give everyone the opportunity to dive in. Itâ€™s no fun if just one person corrects all of the Vale errors in one go, sharing is caring. ðŸ’™
