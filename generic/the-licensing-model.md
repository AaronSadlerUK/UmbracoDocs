# The Licensing Model

Umbraco Forms, Umbraco Deploy, and Umbraco Workflow are commercial products.

- Umbraco Forms - you have a 14-day free trial to try out the product. After your trial expires, you'll need to have a **valid license** to keep using the product on your site. For more information, see the [Umbraco Forms Licensing](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-forms/the-licensing-model) article.

- Umbraco Deploy - doesn't come with a 14-day free trial, which means you will need a **valid license** to use the products. For more information, see the [Umbraco Deploy Licensing](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-deploy/the-licensing-model) article.

- Umbraco Workflow - is a licensed product that does not require a purchase. New installations defaults to a trial license while the paid license is available for purchase. For more information, see the [Umbraco Workflow Licensing](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-workflow/licensing) article.
