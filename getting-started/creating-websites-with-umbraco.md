We've even included some helpful tutorials which you can follow for creating a basic site to get you started.

## How Umbraco works

Your website's content is based on **Document Types**. Each of these Document Types are structured by **Properties** made up of **Data Types**, and each Data Type has an underlying **Property Editor**.

Once you've created content based on the Document Types, they will be published on yourwebsite using **Templates**.
