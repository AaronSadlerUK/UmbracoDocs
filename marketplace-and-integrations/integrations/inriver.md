# Cookiebot Integration

This integration provides a custom product picker for selected products in the [inriver](https://www.inriver.com/) PIM (product information management) system.  It also includes a value converter providing a strongly typed model for rendering and a sample rendering component.

Install from NuGet via:
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.PIM.Inriver

Source code is at:
https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.PIM.Inriver

Available on the Umbraco Marketplace at:
https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/umbraco.cms.integrations.pim.inriver

## Prerequisites

Required minimum versions of Umbraco CMS:
- CMS: 10.3.0

## How To Use

### Authentication

Accessing the resources from inriver through the REST API requires an API key, which will be included with each request using the `X-InRiver-APIKey` header.

To retrieve your API key and instance of your environment, you need to go in the _Users_ section of the _Control Center_ and generate your key.

### Configuration

The following configuration is required for working with the inriver API:

```json
{
  "Umbraco": {
    "CMS": {
      "Integrations": {
        "PIM": {
          "Inriver": {
            "Settings": {
              "ApiBaseUrl": "https://[API_instance].productmarketingcloud.com/",
              "ApiKey": "[API_key]"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Backoffice usage

To use the product picker, a new datatype should be created based on the `inriver Entity Picker` property editor.

If the configuration is not valid, an error message will be displayed.

Otherwise, you will be able to toggle between the __inriver__ entity types of your environment and pick which columns you want displayed.

You select the entity type you want to fetch data for, and retrieve the list of fields and linked entities for it.

### Front-end rendering

A strongly typed model will be generated by the property value converter. An HTML helper is available to render the product on the front-end.

Make sure your template has a reference to the following using statement:

```csharp
@using Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.PIM.Inriver.Helpers;
```

And render the product using (assuming a property based on the created datatype, with alias `inriverProductPicker` has been created):

```csharp
@Html.RenderInriverEntity(Model.InriverProductPicker)
```

You can override the sample rendering component with one of your own by specifying a new path for the view.
