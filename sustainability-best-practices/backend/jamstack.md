# JAMstack

The adoption of [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org/), Static Site Generation (SSG), and CDN distribution stands as a commendable choice from the perspective of sustainable system design. JAMstack's decoupled approach separates the frontend from the backend, allowing for efficient resource allocation and reduced server-side processing. When combined with SSG, which pre-generates static content at build time, this results in decreased server load and faster loading times. 

CDN distribution further amplifies these benefits by delivering content from geographically distributed edge servers, minimizing data transfer distances and latency. This holistic approach not only optimizes user experiences but also significantly reduces energy consumption by minimizing server processing needs and data transmission over long distances. 

By prioritizing resource efficiency and performance, JAMstack, SSG, and CDN distribution align seamlessly with sustainable design principles, creating web systems that operate in an ecologically responsible manner while delivering exceptional user experiences.
