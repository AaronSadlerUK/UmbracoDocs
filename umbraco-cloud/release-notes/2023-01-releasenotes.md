## UK Region Hosting

Umbraco Cloud has reached yet a new milestone with the support of UK region. This is fantastic news for everyone working with or out of Britain. You are now able to create a new Umbraco Cloud project in either "West Europe", "US East", or "UK South" to the delight of the majority of our European and American customers.

With an increasing interest in using Umbraco Cloud as the development and hosting platform for Umbraco projects, weâ€™ve also seen an increased demand for additional (regional) hosting options. Especially when it comes to privacy and data policy requirements, the physical location of the data matters.

Regional Hosting Options make it possible to choose where your Umbraco Cloud project, including all environments and data, is served and stored.

## Display of Multi-factor authentication setting for organisation members

Since October last year, our users have had the opportunity to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) and thereby authenticate with a password and either phone, email or an authenticator app.

Now we deliver the second part of the planned three steps of the MFA feature, by ensuring that an administrator in a cloud organization can see the multi-factor authentication settings for all organization members.

The third and final step will be the enforcement of MFA per user level based on an organization setting. This means that an administrator can set the desired MFA type (email, phone or authenticator app) for each individual user, which will then be imposed on the user at the next login to Umbraco Cloud. This feature is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2023.

## [Prefixes for naming secrets](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/set-up/project-settings/secrets-management)

The naming of secrets is subject to some restrictions to ensure that reserved words and application settings cannot be accidentally overwritten.

Certain application settings should, however, be overwritten precisely under the auspices of security. Whereby it is now possible to overwrite the following three namespaces
- Umbraco:CMS:Global:Smtp
- Umbraco:Forms:Security:FormsApiKey
- Umbraco:Forms:FieldTypes:Recaptcha  

There namespaces are relevant to consider when adding a SMTP to the Umbraco CMS, saving the Umbraco Forms API key, or using the ReChaptcha for Umbraco Forms.
