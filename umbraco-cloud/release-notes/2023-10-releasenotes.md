## Umbraco CI/CD Flow: Bridging Your CI/CD Pipeline with the Cloud

Umbraco CI/CD Flow represents a significant enhancement in how developers can integrate, test, and deploy their projects on Umbraco Cloud. The feature is engineered to function as an extension to your existing CI/CD pipeline, allowing automated deployments directly to Umbraco Cloud. This creates a synergy between your existing robust CI/CD setup and Umbraco Cloud's specialized hosting capabilities that are optimized for Umbraco CMS.

If you already have a CI/CD pipeline, you're halfway there. Umbraco CI/CD Flow brings an added layer of sophistication by allowing seamless integration with Umbraco Cloud through the "Umbraco Public API."

And for those with existing pipelines, you can easily integrate and streamline your deployment process with Umbraco Cloud's specialized hosting capabilities.
